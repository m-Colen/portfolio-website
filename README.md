## Inspiration

This was one of my first major projects. As such I learned a lot of new things like:

* Working with complex animations to add the "Stars" background. 
* Adding an interactive carousel to my projects section.  
* Adding a contact form to the end. I ended up implimenting FormSpark to handle the "back-end" of the contact form.  
* Working to make the site as responsive as possible. I learned a lot about using Dev Tools to test out the responsiveness of the site using different device sizes.  
* Working to make the site as accessible as possible. I used NVDA to test out the site using a screen reader.
